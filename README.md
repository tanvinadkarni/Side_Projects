#Covers Apps
Covers app is a web based application to create high quality covers for books using images and Text.

It uses
- Angular JS 
- 500px REST API  to suggest high resolution images for a given keyword taking care of copyright issues. 
- Adobe Aviary : javascript SDK to edit images in browser
- Cloudnary to store images on CDN 
- Functioning demo can be accessed at [http://bookstruck.in/covers]
- 100s of users on BookStruck.in are using this app to create covers for their books. 

#Screenshots 
Android and iOS app stores require you to upload a lot of graphic assets when you publish your app. It can be a pain if you are a developer and dont have access to expensive tools like Photoshop. 

This tool lets you create those high quality assets with few clicks. Supports Apple iWatch and Android wearables.

It uses
- Angular JS 
- Cloudinary Image processing API
- Functioning demo can be accessed here : [http://bookstruck.in/screenshots]
